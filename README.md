Caesar Cipher Project
Description

This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher, one of the oldest and most straightforward encryption techniques. The script allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using this cipher. It serves as a basic demonstration of encryption and decryption techniques in Python.
Installation

To run this script, you will need Python installed on your system. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from python.org.
Usage

To use this script:

    Clone the repository to your local machine or download the caesar_cipher.py file.

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

    Run the script using Python:

    python caesar_cipher.py

    Follow the on-screen prompts to either encrypt or decrypt a message. You will be asked to:
        Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt (Enter E for encrypt or D for decrypt).
        Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
        Specify the shift value (a number) for the Caesar Cipher.

Example

Do you want to encrypt or decrypt? Enter E for encrypt or D for decrypt: E
Enter your message: Hello World!
Enter the shift value (a number): 3
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog!
